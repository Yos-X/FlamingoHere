For the full list, see [Flamingo Lyric Format Support](docs/LyricFormatSupport_en.md).

### Multiple Extension Support

Lyric Getter API
> Supports Lyric Getter, an Xposed module (now compatible with LSPosed / LSPatch) that retrieves lyrics from music apps via hooking and provides them to other modules / apps. Can be used to implement status bar lyrics.

Super Lyric API
> Supports Super Lyric, a new lyric retriever module with an updated API! Can be used to implement status bar lyrics.

Ticker Lyric
> Supports sending lyrics via the ticker in notifications; some systems / modules can use this feature to retrieve lyrics and provide services like status bar lyrics.

FFmpeg Support
> Supports audio decoding using the FFmpeg aar extension (compliant with the LGPL license), which is enabled by default as a fallback.

### Large Screen Landscape UI Support
Supports landscape UI on large screens, with an interface similar to Apple Music on iPad.

**âš  Landscape UI on small screens is not yet adapted and will force the large screen UI; this is normal.**
